EmotionDetectionEcommerce
Final Project: AI-Based Web Application Development and Deployment

Scenario
You have been hired as a software engineer by an e-commerce company to create an AI-based web app that performs analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. To accomplish this requirement, you will create an Emotion Detection system that processes feedback provided by the customer in text format and deciphers the associated emotion expressed.
Introduction
In this final project, you will be assessed on the knowledge gained on all aspects of app creation and its web deployment throughout this course. You will be required to save screenshots of your results from time to time, with specific nomenclature. These screenshots will have to be uploaded in the peer-graded assignment that follows.
In this project, we use the embeddable Watson AI libraries to create an emotion detection application.
Emotion detection extends the concept of sentiment analysis by extracting finer emotions, like joy, sadness, anger, and more, rather than just polarity. Businesses widely use such systems for AI-based recommendation systems, automated chatbots, and more.
Project Guidelines
For the completion of this project, you'll have to complete the following 8 tasks, based on the knowledge you have gained through the course.
Note: This platform is not persistent. It is recommended that you keep a copy of your code on your local machines and save changes regularly. In case you revisit the lab, you will need to recreate the files using the saved copies from your machines.
Tasks and Objectives
Task 1: Fork and Clone the Project Repository
Fork the repository from GitHub: Project Repository
Ensure your forked repository is Public.
Open a new Terminal and create the `final_project` directory using:
```sh
   mkdir final_project
   ```
Clone the forked repository:
```sh
   git clone <your_forked_repository_url> final_project
   ```
Navigate to the `final_project` directory:
```sh
   cd final_project
   ```
Take a screenshot of your folder structure and save it as `1_folder_structure.png`.
Task 2: Create an Emotion Detection Application using Watson NLP Library
Create a file named `emotion_detection.py` in the `final_project` folder.
Implement the `emotion_detector` function that sends a POST request to the Watson NLP Emotion Predict API.
Test the function using the Python shell:
```sh
   python3.11
   >>> from emotion_detection import emotion_detector
   >>> emotion_detector("I love this new technology.")
   ```
Take a screenshot of your terminal output and save it as `2b_application_creation.png`.
Task 3: Format the Output of the Application
Convert the API response into a dictionary using the `json` library.
Extract emotions: `anger`, `disgust`, `fear`, `joy`, `sadness`.
Determine the dominant emotion.
Modify `emotion_detector` to return:
```json
   {
       "anger": anger_score,
       "disgust": disgust_score,
       "fear": fear_score,
       "joy": joy_score,
       "sadness": sadness_score,
       "dominant_emotion": "<name of the dominant emotion>"
   }
   ```
Take a screenshot and save it as `3a_output_formatting.png`.
Task 4: Package the Application
Create a package named `EmotionDetection`.
Take a screenshot of the `__init__.py` file and folder structure, saving it as `4a_packaging.png`.
Test the package:
```sh
   python3.11
   >>> from EmotionDetection.emotion_detection import emotion_detector
   >>> emotion_detector("I hate working long hours.")
   ```
Take a screenshot and save it as `4b_packaging_test.png`.
Task 5: Run Unit Tests on Your Application
Create `test_emotion_detection.py`.
Write tests for:
Statement	Dominant Emotion
I am glad this happened	joy
I am really mad about this	anger
I feel disgusted just hearing about this	disgust
I am so sad about this	sadness
I am really afraid that this will happen	fear
Execute the test file:
```sh
   python3.11 test_emotion_detection.py
   ```
Take a screenshot of the terminal output and save it as `5b_unit_testing_result.png`.
Task 6: Web Deployment of the Application using Flask
Create `server.py` in `final_project`.
Ensure the Flask route is `/emotionDetector`.
Deploy the app on `localhost:5000`.
Take a screenshot of `server.py` as `6a_server.png`.
Test with: "I think I am having fun" and take a screenshot as `6b_deployment_test.png`.
Task 7: Incorporate Error Handling
Modify `emotion_detector` to handle blank inputs (return `None` values for all keys).
Modify `server.py` to return "Invalid text! Please try again!" for blank entries.
Test error handling and save screenshots:
`7a_error_handling_function.png`
`7b_error_handling_server.png`
`7c_error_handling_interface.png`
Task 8: Run Static Code Analysis
Run Pylint on `emotion_detection.py`:
```sh
   pylint emotion_detection.py
   ```
Take a screenshot of the output and save it as `8a_static_analysis.png`.
Optional: Push Your Code to GitHub
At any point, push your code to your GitHub repository:
```sh
cd final_project
git add .
git commit -m "Final project submission"
git push origin main
```

Conclusion
By completing this project, you will gain hands-on experience in AI-based web app development, API integration, error handling, unit testing, packaging, and deployment using Flask.
